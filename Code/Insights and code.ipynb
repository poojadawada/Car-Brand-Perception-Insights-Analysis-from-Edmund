So probably they are each other's biggest competitors and have very similar cars in the midsize sedans category. Both these companies can leverage this and being mentioned with the other brand would be helpful in promoting the brand.\n","\n","###MDS Plot -\n","What we could find from the analysis is that Asian brands dominate the midsize Sedan market in the US. FORD is the only US brand in the top 5, which means there are some attributes that stand out for Ford compared to rest of US brands. In the MDS plot above, FORD seems to have a place of its own, which provides evidence to our findings.\n","\n","Our recommendation to FORD Management: We are not finding the above trend carried over to the aspiration score. FORD is being talked about a lot, so it is worth investigating the associated customer sentiments and preferences. With proper marketing and branding of DISTINCT features, FORD can challenge for the top spot.\n","\n","###Brand to Attribute lift -\n","Mazda and Chevrolet have an exceptionally good lift with pickup, which could also mean that people are mentioning about pickup trucks of these brands in the discussion about midsize sedans. This could mean people talk about pickup trucks of these brands while talking about sedans. This is a business opportunity for Mazda and Chevrolet to expand their pickup truck business by associating with sedans. Which could be something interesting to look into.\n","\n","###Aspirational brand\n","As we can observe from the lift ratios between brands and aspirations, Mazda seems to be the most aspirational brand and people are showing interest in buying Mazda cars in the future. Our advice to the managers would be to prepare for the forecasted demand and manufacture accordingly. This should lead to higher revenues and profits for Mazda. The product managers of Mazda can also try to check what attributes of the cars are making people want to buy them and the advertising managers can advertise more on those attributes to acquire more customers.\n","\n","On the other hand, brands with low lift scores like Nissan should be concerned since their low lift scores means that people are not aspiring to own their brands. Product managers can try to introduce new features which may bring a change. Advertising managers can try to market the important attributes in such a way that it changes people's perceptions towards the brands."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gVpXm0sI0ymf","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#Code"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7zgvBKavX01V","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##
